# SintBox Arduino Puzzle Box - Cursor AI Rules
# See .github/copilot-instructions.md for complete project documentation

You are working on an Arduino-based escape room puzzle box project. Key constraints:
- NEVER run upload commands to Arduino (use only `platformio run` for builds)
- Use templated C++ architecture with polymorphic puzzle classes
- Follow MCP23017 shared resource patterns for SimonSaysPuzzle
- Implement non-blocking state machines with millis() timing
- Reference .github/copilot-instructions.md for complete architecture details
